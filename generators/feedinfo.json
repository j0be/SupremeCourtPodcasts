J.W., Case No. 2018-0602 \rSixth District Court of Appeals (Lucas County) \rISSUE: For the purpose of calculating child support, are commissions treated in the same manner as overtime and bonuses when determining \"gross income\"? \rBACKGROUND: \rA couple identified in court documents as A.S. and J.W. had a child, who was born in February 2015. The couple ended their relationship before the child was born, but the parents were cooperating and agreed to a shared parenting plan in July 2016. In September 2016, A.S. filed a complaint to establish parental rights and responsibilities and, in August 2016, a trial was conducted on economic issues. \rThe parties presented their incomes from the prior few years and the mother, A.S., indicated she earned $131,000 in 2015 and expected to earn $140,000 in 2016. J.W. testified that the bulk of his earnings were through commissions and, in 2015, he had a base salary of $90,000 and received $212,000 in commissions. For 2016, he stated his salary would increase to $94,000 and his 2016 commissions would be about $369,000. J.W. testified that the 2016 commission was abnormally high due to the product of several years of work that came to fruition in 2016. \rThe magistrate hearing the case ordered J.W. to pay $2,984 per month through 2015 and that beginning in 2016, he would pay $4,372 per month. The magistrate stated the increase was calculated by including the 2016 commission in a three-year average of J.W.'s gross income. The trial court adopted the magistrate's decision, and J.W. objected to the child support award. The trial court affirmed the decision in March 2017, and the father appealed to the Sixth District Court of Appeals. \rCiting R.C. 3119.05(D), J.W. argued that the law prohibited the trial court from using his 2016 commissions to establish his child support obligation. The Sixth District affirmed the lower court decision, noting that the state legislature \"mistakenly included commissions\" in portions of R.C. 3119.05(D), and that the trial court was justified in using the payments to calculate child support. \rJ.W. appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.","duration":"29:35"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-1-30-2019-case-no-2017-1576-kljun-v-admr-bur-of-workers-comp":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-1-30-2019-case-no-2017-1576-kljun-v-admr-bur-of-workers-comp","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - 1-30-2019 - Case No. 2017-1576 Kljun v.

Sarah Morrison, administrator, Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation et al., Case No. 2017-1576 \rEighth District Court of Appeals (Cuyahoga County) \rISSUE: Does the \"law-of-the-case doctrine\" apply only to matters addressed in an earlier appeal of the case or can it extend to issues not addressed in the earlier appeal? \rBACKGROUND: \rAs part of the 2012 mid-biennium budget review bill, state lawmakers amended R.C. 4123.57(B), which required that workers' compensation payments for workers who lost limbs, organs, or other bodily systems to be paid \"loss-of-use\" compensation in weekly installments. Prior to the act, state law had allowed the payments to be made in weekly installments, but also allowed the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) to control the process through rules. In 2010, the BWC approved a rule allowing lump-sum payments for loss-of-use injuries. \rJeffrey Kljun and five other injured workers filed a lawsuit in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court against the bureau, claiming the 2012 amendment violated the one-subject rule of the Ohio Constitution because it was unrelated to the budget bill. The lawsuit requested an injunction that prevented the BWC from enforcing the new law and required lump-sum payments. \rBoth sides asked for summary judgment and the trial court ruled in the BWC's favor. Kljun appealed to the Eighth District Court of Appeals, which reversed the lower court. The Eighth District found the amendment was unconstitutional and directed the trial court to enter a judgment in Kljun's favor. \rThe bureau didn't appeal the decision and neither party submitted any additional motions or documents to the trial court. The trial court then issued a written entry that declared the law unconstitutional and required lump-sum payments. The bureau again appealed the decision to the Eighth District. It argued that by declaring the law unconstitutional, the law reverted back to its prior form. In that form, the BWC was, by law, required to make monthly payments, even though it had the option to alter payments through rule-making. The BWC maintained the Eighth District never ordered the trial court to mandate lump-sum payments. \rThe Eighth District rejected the bureau's appeal, stating the trial court followed the \"law-of-the-case\" doctrine and applied the correct judgment. The BWC appealed the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.","duration":"32:43"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-1-30-2019-case-no-2017-1377-farmers-state-bank-v-sponaugle":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-1-30-2019-case-no-2017-1377-farmers-state-bank-v-sponaugle","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - 1-30-2019 - Case No. 2017-1377 Farmers State Bank v.

On that date, the judge reset the trial for May 2 \"for good cause shown\" and later moved the trial to May 16 \"due to conflicting notices.\" On May 16, Martin's attorney informed the court that he had to withdraw from the case, and Martin found a new lawyer.

State of Ohio \rEleventh District Court of Appeals (Trumbull County) \rNathaniel Jackson is contesting his death sentence in his second direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. He received a new sentencing hearing in 2010 because the prosecutors had helped draft the trial court's sentencing opinion for the judge in his case. \rJackson and Donna Roberts were romantically involved in 2001 while Roberts was living with her ex-husband, Robert Fingerhut. During that year, Jackson went to prison. While there, he and Roberts plotted to kill Fingerhut for $550,000 in insurance money. Fingerhut was shot to death in December 2001, and Roberts and Jackson were each convicted for aggravated murder and received death sentences. \rThe Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Jackson's convictions and death sentence in 2006. Later that year, though, a unanimous Supreme Court sent Roberts' death-penalty appeal back to the trial court for resentencing because Judge John M. Stuard had involved the prosecutor in writing Roberts' sentencing opinion, and did so without the defense counsel's knowledge. Judge Stuard presided over both trials, and was publicly reprimanded by the Court in 2009 for the actions in the Roberts case. The judge acknowledged he enlisted the prosecutor's help in drafting Jackson's sentencing opinion as well, and the Eleventh District Court of Appeals granted Jackson a new sentencing hearing in 2010. \rThe judge held the resentencing hearing on Aug. 14, 2012, and again imposed the death penalty. Jackson has raised 11 arguments in his brief to the Court challenging the death sentence imposed in that hearing.","duration":"2:30:00"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2015-0505-in-re-ds-a-minor-child":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2015-0505-in-re-ds-a-minor-child","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - Case No. 2015-0505 In Re: D.S., A Minor Child","pubdate":"April 5, 2016","description":"In Re: D.S., a minor child, Case No. 2015-0505 \rEighth District Court of Appeals (Cuyahoga County) \rISSUE: Under Ohio law and in accordance with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, must a juvenile court grant credit for time spent in jail in connection with a previously filed case, including time for which a child was held on charges that were dismissed?","duration":"2:30:00"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2015-0473-state-of-ohio-v-jermain-thomas":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2015-0473-state-of-ohio-v-jermain-thomas","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - Case No. 2015-0473 State of Ohio v.

Montgomery was found lying alive on a bed in a separate room.\rMontgomery was charged with the murder of Hendricks, the aggravated murders (four counts) of the children, and domestic violence. The aggravated murder charges included various specifications, which require a greater penalty if certain facts are proven. In this case, the specifications allowed for the death penalty.\rAfter waiving his right to a jury trial, Montgomery entered a guilty plea in May 2012 to all the counts and specifications. Evidence was then presented to the three-judge panel hearing his case. The panel found Montgomery guilty and, following a mitigation hearing, imposed a death sentence.\rMontgomery's attorneys present seven arguments in the appeal to the Supreme Court and ask that the convictions be overturned, the death sentence be set aside, or a new trial be held.","duration":"2:30:00"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2014-0791-deutsche-bank-national-trust-company-as-trustee-v-glenn-e-holden-et-al":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2014-0791-deutsche-bank-national-trust-company-as-trustee-v-glenn-e-holden-et-al","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - Case No. 2014-0791 Deutsche Bank National Trust Company as Trustee v.

After Belton waived his right to a jury trial and pled no contest, a three-judge panel found him guilty of murder and other charges and then sentenced him to death. Belton is appealing his death sentence and convictions.\rOn the morning of Aug. 13, 2008, a woman stopped at a Toledo BP service station to pick up a muffin and coffee. No one was attending the counter. As the woman left, she glanced back through a window and saw a man surrounded by blood on the floor behind the counter. She called 911.\rThe clerk, Matthew Dugan, had died from a gunshot wound to the back of the head. According to the store owner, a number of prepaid phone cards and approximately $600 in cash also had been taken. Security video showed a man entering and exiting the store three times that morning, minutes apart. The third time, the man walked up to the counter with two bottled drinks and then pointed a gun at Dugan. Dugan gave cash to the man and handed over other items. The man subsequently made motions toward something behind Dugan. When the clerk turned around in that direction, the man shot him.\rInformation led police to Belton, who was arrested along with two other men. Belton gave varying accounts to police about the events of that morning. With Belton's help, police searched the yard of the house where he was living and found a 9 mm gun.","duration":"2:30:00"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2015-0121-wayne-lipperman-et-al-v-nile-batman-et-al":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2015-0121-wayne-lipperman-et-al-v-nile-batman-et-al","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - Case No. 2015-0121 Wayne Lipperman, et al. v.

DeMarco, Case no. 2014-1738\rThe state disciplinary board recommends that the Supreme Court suspend Robert P. DeMarco of Solon for one year for lying repeatedly to a court, creating a potential harm to an expert witness, and for failing to show remorse for his actions until he was caught.\rDeMarco represented a client in a defamation lawsuit against the client's former business partners. The suit alleged that the former partners wrote and shared defamatory statements about DeMarco's client with a new employer.\rAs part of discovery in the case, DeMarco requested copies of the former partners' hard drives. DeMarco hired Jack Harper, a data expert, to obtain the records. In June 2011, the parties agreed to a protocol for copying and searching the files, and the agreement provided that the judge would conduct an in camera inspection to decide which documents to give to DeMarco.\rAccording to the board's report, Harper obtained the records, filtered the data according to the agreement, and gave a disk with the filtered results to DeMarco. But the disk wasn't provided to the judge. DeMarco then searched the data himself.\rAt a pretrial conference in March 2012, DeMarco told the judge and opposing counsel that he had not looked at the results of the records search. After the conference, he left a voicemail with Harper about his statements.\rThe parties settled, but the former partners wanted the disk. At a November hearing, opposing counsel focused on questioning Harper about what happened to the disk. In a conversation with the judge and during his testimony, DeMarco never supported the expert or admitted that he had reviewed the filtered data, the board noted.\rDuring the disciplinary proceedings, DeMarco and the Toledo Bar Association, which filed the complaint in the case, agreed that the attorney had violated three professional conduct rules. The panel that reviewed the case also determined that DeMarco acted with a dishonest motive, an aggravating factor, and that there were three mitigating circumstances.\rWhile the panel recommended a one-year suspension with six months stayed, the board recommends a greater sanction of a full one-year suspension.","duration":"2:30:00"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2013-0433-in-the-matter-of-the-application-to-modify-in-accordance-with-section-492908-revised-code-the-exemption-granted-to-the-east-ohio-gas-company-dba-dominion-east-ohio-in-case-no-07-1224-ga-exm":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2013-0433-in-the-matter-of-the-application-to-modify-in-accordance-with-section-492908-revised-code-the-exemption-granted-to-the-east-ohio-gas-company-dba-dominion-east-ohio-in-case-no-07-1224-ga-exm","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - Case No. 2013-0433 In the Matter of the Application to Modify, in accordance with Section 4929.08, Revised Code, the Exemption Granted to The East Ohio Gas Company d\/b\/a Dominion East Ohio in Case No. 07-1224-GA-EXM","pubdate":"May 6, 2015","description":"Did PUCO's Approval of Change to Natural Gas Supplier Choices Meet Statutory Requirements?\rIn the Matter of the Application to Modify ... the Exemption Granted to The East Ohio Gas Company d\/b\/a Dominion East Ohio ..., Case No. 2013-0433\rPublic Utilities Commission of Ohio\rISSUES: \r-\tDid the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) first find an exemption order invalid, as required by statute, before modifying the order?\r-\tDid the evidence support the finding that the 2008 exemption order was no longer valid?\r-\tWas it established that the natural gas company, suppliers, and customers would be adversely affected if the \"standard choice offer\" service was continued?\r-\tDid the PUCO show that the public's interest would be advanced by modifying the 2008 order?","duration":"2:30:00"},"..\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2014-0140-navistar-inc-v-richard-a-levin-tax-commissioner-of-ohio":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/supreme-court-of-ohio-case-no-2014-0140-navistar-inc-v-richard-a-levin-tax-commissioner-of-ohio","title":"Supreme Court of Ohio - Case No. 2014-0140 Navistar, Inc. v.

The statute:  1) assists the parent or custodian of a child in obtaining an enforceable child support order against a non-custodial parent who currently resides in a different state; and 2) prevents the issuance of conflicting child support orders by courts in different states by establishing an agreement that, once a valid support order has been issued by a court in one state, that state retains exclusive jurisdiction over issues of child support involving the subject child.

Cook, Case no. 2009-21226th District Court of Appeals (Lucas County)ISSUE:  R.C. 2901.13 establishes the \"statutes of limitations\" (legal time limits) after the commission of various types of crimes within which the state must initiate prosecution of a suspected offender. The statute generally provides that failure to prosecute a crime before the statutory deadline has expired will permanently bar the state from pursuing criminal charges against a suspected offender for that conduct.  However, the law also sets forth certain circumstances under which the limitations period for prosecuting a crime is \"tolled\" (stopped from running).

Kenneth Hodge, Case no. 2009-19971st District Court of Appeals (Hamilton County)ISSUE: In State v. Foster (2006), the Supreme Court of Ohio severed (declared unenforceable) on constitutional grounds two provisions of Ohio's criminal sentencing statute that authorized judges (rather than juries) to make factual findings that supported: 1) the imposition of a non-minimum sentence on an offender for a single criminal offense and 2) the imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences on an offender convicted of multiple crimes. By severing those provisions, the Foster decision effectively gave Ohio trial court judges full discretion to impose any sentence within the statutory sentencing range for a defendant's offense, and to determine whether it was appropriate for an offender convicted of multiple crimes to serve his sentences for those crimes concurrently (at the same time) or consecutively (one after the other) without making the specific factual findings in support of a non-minimum or consecutive sentence that were previously required under the severed provisions. In this case, the Supreme Court of Ohio is asked to determine whether, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2009 holding in Oregon v. Ice that an Oregon law authorizing judges to make factual findings to support consecutive sentences was not unconstitutional, Ohio courts must resume making the judicial findings that were required under the state's pre-Foster sentencing law in order to validly impose consecutive sentences.","duration":"43:57"},"..\/video\/case-no-2009-2004-rumpke-sanitary-landfill-inc-v-state-of-ohio-and-colerain-township":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/case-no-2009-2004-rumpke-sanitary-landfill-inc-v-state-of-ohio-and-colerain-township","title":"Case No. 2009-2004 Rumpke Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.

However, under a different section of the same statute, R.C. 5103.16(E), if the party seeking to become the child's adoptive parent is the child's step parent, grandparent or legal guardian, the law states that those persons may apply in probate court to legally adopt the child without the consent of the child's natural parents if: 1) the prospective adopter demonstrates to the court that  the natural parents have abandoned the child by failing without justifiable cause to have any meaningful contact with or to provide for the support of the child for one year or longer; 2) the court finds the proposed adoptive home suitable, and 3) the court finds that the proposed adoption is in the best interest of the child.

Effective in April 2005, the legislature adopted a new collateral source statute, R.C. 2315.20, which does not permit a defendant to introduce evidence of benefits a plaintiff received for his injuries from his own insurance or from other outside sources if the source of those payments has a legal right to subrogation, (i.e., if the plaintiff will be obliged to pay back money he received from that source from the proceeds of any court judgment or settlement he obtains from the defendant).","duration":"43:24"},"..\/video\/case-no-2009-0933-julie-volbers-klarich-v-middletown-management-inc-et-al":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/case-no-2009-0933-julie-volbers-klarich-v-middletown-management-inc-et-al","title":"Case No. 2009-0933 Julie Volbers-Klarich v.

If the defendant successfully completes the intervention in lieu of conviction (ILC) program and does not reoffend, the drug offense may be expunged (deleted) from the defendant's record. The statute specifies that certain offenders are not eligible for placement in an ILC program. One of those exceptions, set forth in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d), bars from eligibility an offender who \"held a public office or position of trust and the offense related to that office or position.\" In this case, the Court is asked to resolve conflicting rulings by the state's courts of appeals regarding whether the statutory exclusion for persons in a \"position of trust\" broadly bars a nurse or other private employee from participating in an ILC program for a drug-related offense if that offense was committed in the course of his or her employment.","duration":"37:48"},"..\/video\/case-no-2009-0580-cora-erwin-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-russel-erwin-v-joseph-e-bryan-md-et-al":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/case-no-2009-0580-cora-erwin-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-russel-erwin-v-joseph-e-bryan-md-et-al","title":"Case No. 2009-0580 Cora Erwin, Administratrix of the Estate of Russel Erwin v.

Front Street in Columbus .In 1873, the Ohio Supreme Court put an end to the Cincinnati Bible War, declaring the city's Board of Education could end Bible reading in its schools. The controversy had convulsed the city, riveted the eyes of the nation, provoked a petition drive, and then a lawsuit. Now, the Bible had lost. Or had it?The decision pointed to the Ohio Constitution, but then offered its own Bible lesson: compulsory Bible reading violated Christ's Golden Rule. It was an unusual legal reasoning, but a powerful argument in a land dotted with church steeples.It was attorney Stanley Matthews who returned to Ohio to argue the case for the school board and defended religious liberty in the name of Christianity. His own inspiration lay decades in the past when scarlet fever raged in Ohio . It was an epidemic that changed Matthews, Ohio law and religious liberty forever.Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer said he hopes history buffs and legal scholars turn out to learn more about the case. \"It is certainly interesting that a past decision of the Ohio Supreme Court - even one that is 136 years old - has a lasting impact still being talked about today,\" he said. \"It just proves that the law today has its roots in the past.\"For more information and to view a short video clip of Professor Przybyszewski discussing the case, visit www.supremecourt.ohio.gov\/biblewar.","duration":"58:00"},"..\/video\/columbus-bar-association-v-american-family-prepaid-legal-corporation-et-al-case-no-2005-0422":{"link":"https:\/\/ohiochannel.org\/video\/columbus-bar-association-v-american-family-prepaid-legal-corporation-et-al-case-no-2005-0422","title":"Columbus Bar Association  v.
